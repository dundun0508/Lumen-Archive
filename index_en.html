    <p>This is an early masterpiece from Monet's Water Lilies series at Giverny. The painting captures the reflection of sky and flora on the water's surface through countless fragmented strokes of green and lavender, with a cluster of pink water lilies at the center, exemplifying the Impressionist pursuit of light and color.</p>
